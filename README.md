# External Link In New Window

[phpBB 3.1] (https://www.phpbb.com/) Extension External Link In New Window

## Description

Modifies external links (i.e. links to a resource outside of your board) to open in a new browser window by default.

Works without JavaScript, the needed attributes are injected into the HTML output. Also adds the ability to add the *rel=nofollow* attribute to external links.

The extension can be configured in the Admin Control Panel:
* Allow users to choose for themselves if they would like to open external links in a new window.
* Or force external links to be opened in a new window for registered users.
* Open external links in new window for guests.
* Open external links in new window for bots.

If enabled in the Admin Control Panel, the board users can configure in their User Control Panel if they would like to open external links in a new window. You can configure a default behavior in the Admin Control Panel that is used if a user does not choose a setting on his own.

The extension only modifies these links when displaying a message (post, private message, etc.). It does not alter the messages that are stored into the database.
